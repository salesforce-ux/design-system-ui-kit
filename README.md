## Contribute!

The SLDS team welcomes your help in maintaining and growing this UI kit.

Here are a few of the kinds of contributions we are looking for:

1. **Bug fixes:** fixing goofs in the Sketch file where what it has for a component doesn’t match what we are displaying for that component in the code-based documentation
2. **New Pattern:** sharing your design for arranging several components into a useful UI widget
