## Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) UI Kit

The Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) UI Kit is a collection of design resources to support designing and prototyping using <a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com" target="_blank">Lightning Design System</a> components, tokens, and design patterns. There are also useful resources to help make design workflows more efficient with artifacts like page templates, wireframes, key product screens, and components for writing specifications.
